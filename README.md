## Getting Started

This project requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can run the setup script which will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies for you:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
